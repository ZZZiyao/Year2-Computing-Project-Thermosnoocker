This project simulates a 2D gas model to study the effects of varying coefficients of restitution (CoR) on the thermodynamic properties of a gas.

balls.py and simulations.py simulate ideal gas with CoR=1.0

balls_with_restitution.py and simulations_with_restitution.py simulate non-ideal gas where CoR=0.8 and 0.9

Figures and explanation of algorithms & theories are all included in my [report](https://github.com/ZZZiyao/Year-2-Computing-Project-Thermosnoocker/blob/main/computing_report.pdf). 

This repository is intended for academic and personal use ONLY.
