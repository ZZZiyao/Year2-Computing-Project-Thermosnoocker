This project simulates a 2D gas model to study the effects of varying coefficients of restitution (CoR) on the thermodynamic properties of a gas.

balls.py and simulations.py simulate ideal gas with CoR=1.0

balls_with_restitution.py and simulations_with_restitution.py simulate non-ideal gas where CoR=0.8 and 0.9
